# Memex — Task Backlog

## ✅ Critical: Test Coverage (DONE — 65 tests passing)

### 1. `server/src/services/keepImporter.ts` ✅
- [x] Parses `Keep/*.json` path correctly
- [x] Parses `Takeout/Keep/*.json` path (bug we already hit)
- [x] Skips notes with empty title AND empty content
- [x] Deduplicates by content hash
- [x] Handles malformed JSON entries without crashing

### 2. `server/src/routes/items.ts` ✅
- [x] GET /api/items — list with type/category/tag filters
- [x] GET /api/items — `pendingEnrichment=true` filter
- [x] GET /api/items — `enriched=true` filter
- [x] POST /api/items — creates item, sets categories and tags
- [x] PUT /api/items/:id — updates title, categories, tags
- [x] DELETE /api/items/:id — soft delete (sets deleted_at)
- [x] GET /api/items/stats — returns correct counts
- [x] GET /api/items/enrichment — pending vs total counts

### 3. `server/src/db/helpers.ts` — `resolveCategoryPath` ✅

- [x] Creates child category under existing parent
- [x] Creates full 3-level path: Food > Savory > Indian
- [x] ON CONFLICT partial-index fix is regression-covered

### 4. `server/src/routes/ingest.ts` ✅
- [x] POST /api/ingest/keep — parses uploaded ZIP, returns notes array
- [x] POST /api/ingest/keep/bulk — saves notes to DB, starts background job
- [x] GET /api/ingest/jobs/:id — returns job progress
- [x] POST /api/ingest/text — classifies plain text

### 5. `server/src/routes/vault.ts` ✅
- [x] Create vault item (encrypted payload stored correctly)
- [x] Read vault item requires auth
- [x] Delete vault item — 204 on success, 404 on miss

## 🟡 Medium Priority

- [ ] `server/src/services/classifier.ts` — classify() returns valid schema for recipe, media, note, book types
- [ ] `server/src/routes/categories.ts` — tree structure, item counts
- [ ] `server/src/routes/search.ts` — semantic search returns ranked results
- [ ] `client/src/lib/crypto.ts` — expand beyond happy path (wrong password, corrupted ciphertext)

---

## 🟢 Features / Improvements

- [ ] Wire up model selector in Settings (llama3.2 vs gemma3:4b)
- [ ] Pagination on Dashboard and category pages (currently limited to 12/50)
- [ ] Bulk delete from PendingItems / EnrichedItems pages
- [ ] Export enriched items as CSV in addition to JSON
- [ ] PWA: test offline mode and share-target flow
